We'll build the same system you've seen on the quickstart, web searching system; but this time, we will carefully look at each step.

## Create a manager object

**Agent systems require a lot of resources.** Most of the resources are cluttered and unorganized. With a manager object, we register such resources at once for easier access.


<Callout>
We recommend connecting to our open-source observability platform, [Chetanbase](). It provides a unified view of all your agent systems, including their performance, usage, and other metrics.
</Callout>
<Callout>
[Snayu Cloud]() is a fully-managed Chetanbase service. You can [signup for free](https://google.com) and start collecting metrics right away.

## Primitives

### Language models

Language models need to be aligned with our specific use case. Using generic pre-trained models often leads to vague responses, hallucinations, and potential harm.

#### The need for alignment

While API providers like OpenAI offer access to base models and some fine-tuning capabilities, they still lack advanced alignment techniques like RLHF with algorithms such as [GRPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300). As responsible developers, we should at minimum perform Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt models to our specific needs.

#### Chetan's alignment capabilities

So we added built-in SFT and RL capabilities using GRPO to [zerve](https://github.com/snayu-ai/zerve), the official agent system server for chetan. With zerve, we can host both, the language models and agent systems in one server.

Tighter integration between LMs and agent systems produces reduce latency, increase efficiency and yield better results.

<Tabs items={['Zerve', 'OpenAI']}>
  <Tab value="Zerve">
    ```python
    from chetan.lm.zerve import ZerveLM
    import os

    # Set the environment variable for zerve server
    os.environ["ZERVO_SERVER"] = "http://localhost:8724"  # Replace with your zerve server URL

    llm = ZerveLM()

    # Set as the default language model
    mgr.llm.default = llm
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="OpenAI">
    ```python
    from chetan.lm.openai import OpenAILM

    llm = OpenAILM()

    # Set as the default language model
    mgr.llm.default = llm s
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
<Callout type="warn">
  OpenAI, Anthropic, and similar cloud models currently don't support RL through GRPO via API, so *continuous learning* is not possible.

</Callout>
<Callout>
  We recommend using local models through Zerve. This allows continuous learning and alignment of the models.

</Callout>

### Modules

When we want to extend the agent's architecture with new functionality, `modules` make extension effortless. Chetan provides built-in modules for diverse range of abilities like Recommendation, Memory, RAG.

```python
from chetan.modules.rec import ToolRecommender
from chetan.modules.memory import SimpleKVMemory

# Embedding-based recommender to suggest relevant tools
tool_rec = ToolRecommender()
# based on the current context and user input
kv_mem = SimpleKVMemory(k=4)
```

### Agent architecture

We will use the `AgentLoop`class. Applying sequential modules, we can extend various stages of the loop, enabling vertical integration of the agent's capabilities. This allows us to create a more complex and capable agent system.

```python
from chetan.agent import AgentLoop

# Sequentially use the agent modules
DefaultAgentLoop = AgentLoop().use(
  tool_rec,
  kv_mem
)

# Register the agent loop as default
mgr.agent_loops["default"] = DefaultAgentLoop
```
