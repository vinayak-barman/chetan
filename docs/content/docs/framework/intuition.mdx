## AI Agents
AI agents have been there around for a while. Based on reinforcement learning techniques, they analyze the environment and take actions to maximize the reward.

Core characteristics of agents include:
- Take actions
- Learn from the environment
- Adapt to changes
- Make decisions
- Collaborate with other agents

### Making a language model agent

[ReAct](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629) is a popular approach to build language model agents. It combines reasoning and acting, allowing the agent to reason about its actions and take appropriate actions based on the reasoning.

- Adding vision capabilities

- Workflows
