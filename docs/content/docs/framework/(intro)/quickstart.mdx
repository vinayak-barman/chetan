Within 5 minutes, we will build an **internet searching agent system** that can search the internet, check for plagiarism, and rewrite search results. This is a simple example of how to use Chetan to create an agent system.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Installing the python package
```bash
pip install chetan
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Importing necessary modules
```python title="quickstart.py"
# A manager to organize resources
from chetan import ChetanManager

# Language model support for OpenAI
from chetan.lm.openai import OpenAILM

# Tool recommendation and memory modules
from chetan.modules.rec import ToolRecommender
from chetan.modules.memory import SimpleKVMemory

# Importing the agent loop
from chetan.agent import AgentLoop
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Setup resources
```python title="quickstart.py"
# Initialize a manager for organizing resources
mgr = ChetanManager()

# Make sure to set the OpenAI API key "OPENAI_API_KEY" in your environment variables
llm = OpenAILM()

# Register the LLM with the manager
mgr.llm.default = llm
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Defining agent architecture
```python title="quickstart.py"
# Embedding-based recommender to suggest relevant tools
tool_rec = ToolRecommender() 
# based on the current context and user input
kv_mem = SimpleKVMemory(k=4)

# Sequentially use the agent modules
DefaultAgentLoop = AgentLoop().use(
  tool_rec,
  kv_mem
)

# Register the agent loop as default
mgr.agent_loops["default"] = DefaultAgentLoop
```
