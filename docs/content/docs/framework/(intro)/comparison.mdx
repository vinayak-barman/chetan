Chetan is a powerful framework for building agent systems, but how does it compare to other frameworks like [Agno](https://agno.com/), [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/), [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/), and [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)? Let's take a look at some of the key differences and similarities.
## Focus on Agents
Chetan is tailored for building agent systems, offering specialized tools like reinforcement learning and alignment techniques, unlike broader AI frameworks.

## Alignment-First
Built with alignment in mind, Chetan simplifies the implementation of techniques such as reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning, setting it apart from other frameworks.

## Observability
Chetan's advanced observability features enable real-time monitoring of agent behavior and performance, ensuring systems operate as intended.

## Flexibility-First
Designed for flexibility, Chetan allows developers to customize and extend the framework to suit various needs, adapting to diverse use cases.

## End-to-End Lifecycle
Chetan provides a comprehensive lifecycle for agent development, from design to deployment and monitoring, equipping developers with all necessary tools.

## Performance
Optimized for performance, Chetan ensures agents function efficiently in real-time, distinguishing it from frameworks that may not prioritize speed.

## Community
As an open-source project, Chetan boasts a growing community that fosters collaboration and innovation, encouraging the sharing of ideas and best practices.
