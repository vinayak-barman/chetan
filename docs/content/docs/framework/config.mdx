## Writing a config file
To speed up the process of creating agents, we can define a config file in YAML format. This file will contain all the necessary information about the agents, how they communicate, their rules, and the tools they will use.

```yaml
llm:
  default:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o-mini
    temperature: 0.7
rules:
  factual_feedback: "Ensures the accuracy and truthfulness of information presented. Verifies claims and negatives spreading misinformation."
  comprehensive_search: "Conducts thorough and wide-ranging searches to gather relevant information from diverse sources."
  source_evaluation: "Critically evaluates the credibility and reliability of sources to prioritize trustworthy information."
  information_synthesis: "Combines information from multiple sources to create a coherent and comprehensive understanding of the topic."
  bias_detection: "Identifies and mitigates potential biases in search results and information sources."
  present_search_results: "Presents search results in a clear, concise, and organized manner."
  rewrite_search_results: "Rewrites search results to align with a specific objective or viewpoint."
  alignment: "Ensures that the rewritten search results are aligned with the desired objective or viewpoint."
entities:
  human:
    user: "User wants to find information on a specific topic and requires assistance in conducting research, evaluating sources, and synthesizing information."
  agent:
    web_researcher: 
      description: "Conducts comprehensive online research, evaluates sources critically, synthesizes information from diverse sources, and presents factual findings while minimizing bias."
      rules:
        - factual_feedback
        - comprehensive_search
        - source_evaluation
        - information_synthesis
        - bias_detection
        - present_search_results
    search_result_rewriter:
      description: "Rewrites and reformats search results to improve clarity, readability, and alignment with specific objectives while maintaining factual accuracy."
      rules:
        - rewrite_search_results
        - alignment
tools:
  # We only need to search the internet and check for plagiarism
  - internet.search.tavily
  - internet.plagiarism_checker
system:
  default:
    description: "A network of agents and a user, where the user interacts with the web_researcher agent to conduct research, and the web_researcher interacts with the search_result_rewriter agent to refine and present the findings."
    topology: network
    connections:
      # Two way communication between the user and the web researcher is allowed, but rewriter has 
      # two-way communication allowed only between it and the researcher. To send information to the 
      # user, it would need to pass it through the researcher.
      - "user <-> web_researcher <-> search_result_rewriter"
