For multi-entity systems, effective communication is crucial. Protocols are the means by which agents communicate with each other. They define the rules and conventions for exchanging information, ensuring that messages are understood and processed correctly.

There are two types of protocols.

## Communication protocol

A free-text protocol that allows agents to communicate with each other. It is a simple and flexible way to exchange information between agents.

## Structured protocol
A type-safe protocol using structured data with a schema. It is a more complex and powerful way to exchange information between agents. It is useful when you need to ensure that the data being exchanged is valid and conforms to a specific structure.
